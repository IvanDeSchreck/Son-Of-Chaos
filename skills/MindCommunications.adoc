= Description

What could be more important than the communication of two warriors during battle? But with the loud noises of the battlefield, speech is hard to make reliable. As such the perfect way to communicate is to use one's mind. Not only is it not influenced by outside noises, but it also allows for a more efficient form of information exchange.   

This is the servant version and can only be used between either the servant and master or the servant and another servant of the same master.
