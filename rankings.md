# Rankings
Items and skills are ranked by their rarity and power.

The usual ranks are from F to A. Then comes S and SS. Finally there are the special ranks such as legendary, unique and artifact.
Legendary means extraordinary rare as well as powerful. Unique means they are more or less unique.
And finally artifact which is the highest grade and is outside of the [realm](./realms.md) ranking means that they scale with the strength of the user.
