= World Awareness (passive) 

Acquired: Ch 131

Rank: C + 
Type: Passive, Support

While it is unrealistic to continuously scan the surroundings actively, for an adventurer it is still a necessity to be aware of the surroundings.

By drastically reducing the amount of Mental Energy used to scan as well as more radical filters, it is possible to scan the surroundings without much strain. In fact, the strain is even lower than the recovery rate.

Of course, this to the detriment of sensitivity and range.

= Effect
